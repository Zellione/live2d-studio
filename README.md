# live2d-studio

A local, open-source-first pipeline that turns one or more character images into an animated Live2D avatar usable in the SillyTavern Live2D extension.

**Status:** Phase 0 passed for a geometric PSD2Live 3.6.7 fixture in an isolated
copy of the installed SillyTavern Live2D extension, including rendering and reload.
See [compatibility results and reproduction](docs/compatibility.md).
A usable character rig, visible lip sync and emotion behavior remain unvalidated.

## Constraints

- Linux (Arch + Hyprland/XWayland), no Photoshop or paid Cubism dependency.
- Prefer local inference on an RTX 5090; use `uv` for Python dependencies.
- Codex CLI runs locally, with a loopback-only PSD2Live MCP connection.
- Minimize manual image editing. Preserve originals and intermediate assets.
- Validate the final model in the *actual SillyTavern extension*, not just PSD2Live's preview.

## First task

Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and [`docs/HANDOVER.md`](docs/HANDOVER.md). Start **Phase 0** only: inspect the installed SillyTavern Live2D extension and PSD2Live output, produce a documented compatibility matrix, and identify a minimal viable smoke test. Do not assume `.model3.json` works just because PSD2Live exports it.

## Project structure

- `docs/HANDOVER.md` – objective, phases, milestones, acceptance criteria
- `AGENTS.md` – instructions for local Codex agents
- `assets/input/` – user-supplied source images (ignored by Git)
- `assets/intermediate/` – generated segmentation, inpainting, PSDs (ignored by Git)
- `assets/output/` – generated Live2D bundles and previews (ignored by Git)
- `src/live2d_studio/` – future pipeline code
- `tests/` – test assets and automated checks
- `scripts/preflight.sh` – read-only check of host prerequisites
- `scripts/install-psd2live.sh` – SHA-256-verified Linux x64 release installer
